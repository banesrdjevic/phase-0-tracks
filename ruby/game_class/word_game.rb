# Input: winning_phrase,

# check_guess_and_count
# Input: current_guess, array of previous_guesses, 
# Steps: create array to store previous_guesses, check current_guess against previous guesses stored in the array, if equal, donâ€™t increment guess count
# Output: @guess_count

# check_word
# Input: winning_phrase, current_guess
# Steps: check if winning_phrase = current_guess
# Output: true false value for match

# check_letter
# Input: winning_phrase, phrase w/ dashes (previous_guesses), letter from user 2 (current_guess)
# Steps: check if phrase contains letter, change dash to letter,
# Output: dashed_phrase, true false value for match

#DRIVER CODE
puts "Hello and Welcome to Word Guess Game!"
game = WordGame.new
# 2 Users
# User 1 enters phrase
puts "User 1 please enter a secret phrase"
winning_phrase = gets.chomp

# convert phrase to series of dashes to show user 2
# User 2 begins to guess
# letter or word?
# if word call method to check word
# if letter call method to check letter
# if letter is correct, the dash is replaced by the letter
# Make # of guesses possible equal to word length
# If guess is the same as prev, guess does not count, 
# - store guesses and iterate through an array

# If letter is correct, 
# win message if winning
# lose message if losing

puts "Congrats! You're a winner!"

puts "Wah, wah, wah... you LOSE.  Game Over."
