Observe how the driver code acts as a bridge between the class and the user. Are there times when user input cannot be passed directly to the class, and instead must be adjusted from "human logic" to "computer logic"?

- Incorrect user input would be converted to nil in the case that the user doesn’t enter data correctly.  Then guess - 1 would covert that nil to a -1 which would be valid I believe.


What would you have to change if you wanted to limit how many guesses the user gets?
- You could adjust the while loop to include a counter.
