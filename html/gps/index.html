<!-- HTML 5 Semantic tags are high level formatting tags that are used most often in conjunction with other software to assist people with disabilities and special needs.  Really interesting, because one of my college pals, now pro triathlete Aaron Scheidies http://cdifferentwithaaron.com/ is visually impaired and used to use a screen reader in college all the time to read email and search the web. -->
<!-- What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?  Browser typically reads from top to bottom to load a page. -->
<!-- Learned you can create your own snippets or starter pages of code that you can quickly load.  So in the case that you find yourself writing a lot of the same code again and again for different projects, you can create a snippet to use as a starting framework and save yourself time.  Definitely see myself creating more of these in the future.  Wish I had created some along the way, be nice to have a blank table format, a blank form format, etc. -->
<!-- Still a little confused on some of the specific html formatting from time to time.  Think the best thing I can do is keep drilling it over and over until it becomes second nature. -->
